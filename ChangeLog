v3.0.0	Make a branch to hold old Buster files - called Buster. The Master
	now is aimed at Bullseye.

	Change the way that modifications to the distributed files are
	installed. This package now copies all the sympl.d files into
	sympl-local.d, and the changes files in sympl-local.d. The package
	is activated using the Makefile in /etc/dovecot and /etc/exim4,
	which becomes a link to either Makefile.sympl or Makefile.local.
	The command makefilecheck manages the switch between the revised
	and distributed systems. It's now easy to switch between the two
	installations and also to completely remove this set of updates.

	There are small changes to the configuration installed by the
	package and things are now somewhat better commented.

v2.0.0	Remove files not used by this installation, leaving only the files
	that are needed.
	Add Install.sh script to automatically install the files, having
	taken a backup.
	Add support for Spamhaus dbl lists
	Rework documentation.

v1.0.0	Original version, basically installing the changes so that
	the github commit message signalled the change

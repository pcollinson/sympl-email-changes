## Dovecot configuration file

# If you're in a hurry, see http://wiki.dovecot.org/QuickConfiguration

# '#' character and everything after it is treated as comments. Extra spaces
# and tabs are ignored. If you want to use either of these explicitly, put the
# value inside quotes, eg.: key = "# char and trailing whitespace  "

# Default values are shown for each setting, it's not required to uncomment
# any of the lines. Exception to this are paths, they're just examples with
# the real defaults being based on configure options. The paths listed here
# are for configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
# --with-ssldir=/etc/ssl

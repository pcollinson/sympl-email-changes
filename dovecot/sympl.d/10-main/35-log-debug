# Log filter is a space-separated list conditions. If any of the conditions
# match, the log filter matches (i.e. they're ORed together). Parenthesis
# are supported if multiple conditions need to be matched together.
# Supported conditions are:
#  event:<name wildcard> - Match event name. '*' and '?' wildcards supported.
#  source:<filename>[:<line number>] - Match source code filename [and line]
#  field:<key>=<value wildcard> - Match field key to a value. Can be specified
#    multiple times to match multiple keys.
#  cat[egory]:<value> - Match a category. Can be specified multiple times to
#    match multiple categories.
# For example: event:http_request_* (cat:error cat:storage)

# Filter to specify what debug logging to enable. This will eventually replace
# mail_debug and auth_debug settings.
#log_debug =

# Crash after logging a matching event. For example category:error will crash
# any time an error is logged, which can be useful for debugging.
#log_core_filter =

# Log unsuccessful authentication attempts and the reasons why they failed.
auth_verbose = yes

# In case of password mismatches, log the attempted password. Valid values are
# no, plain and sha1. sha1 can be useful for detecting brute force password
# attempts vs. user simply trying the same password over and over again.
# You can also truncate the value to n chars by appending ":n" (e.g. sha1:6).
#auth_verbose_passwords = no

# Even more verbose logging for debugging purposes. Shows for example SQL
# queries.
#auth_debug = no

# In case of password mismatches, log the passwords and used scheme so the
# problem can be debugged. Enabling this also enables auth_debug.
#auth_debug_passwords = no

# Enable mail process debugging. This can help you figure out why Dovecot
# isn't finding your mails.
#mail_debug = no

# Show protocol level SSL errors.
#verbose_ssl = no

# mail_log plugin provides more event logging for mail processes.
plugin {
  # Events to log. Also available: flag_change append
  #mail_log_events = delete undelete expunge copy mailbox_delete mailbox_rename
  # Available fields: uid, box, msgid, from, subject, size, vsize, flags
  # size and vsize are available only for expunge and copy events.

  # POP3 UIDL format to use. You can use following variables:
  #
  #  %v - Mailbox UIDVALIDITY
  #  %u - Mail UID
  #  %m - MD5 sum of the mailbox headers in hex (mbox only)
  #  %f - filename (maildir only)
  #
  # If you want UIDL compatibility with other POP3 servers, use:
  #  UW's ipop3d         : %08Xv%08Xu
  #  Courier version 0   : %f
  #  Courier version 1   : %u
  #  Courier version 2   : %v-%u
  #  Cyrus (<= 2.1.3)    : %u
  #  Cyrus (>= 2.1.4)    : %v.%u
  #  Older Dovecots      : %v.%u
  #  tpop3d              : %Mf
  #
  # Note that Outlook 2003 seems to have problems with %v.%u format which was
  # Dovecot's default, so if you're building a new server it would be a good
  # idea to change this. %08Xu%08Xv should be pretty fail-safe.
  #
  # NOTE: Nowadays this is required to be set explicitly, since the old
  # default was bad but it couldn't be changed without breaking existing
  # installations. %08Xu%08Xv will be the new default, so use it for new
  # installations.
  #
  pop3_uidl_format = %08Xu%08Xv

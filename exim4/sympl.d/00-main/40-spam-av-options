# If you are running a version of Exim that was compiled with the content-
# scanning extension, you can cause incoming messages to be automatically
# scanned for viruses. You have to modify the configuration in two places to
# set this up. The first of them is here, where you define the interface to
# your scanner. This example is typical for ClamAV; see the manual for details
# of what to set for other virus scanners. The second modification is in the
# acl_check_data access control list (see below).

av_scanner = clamd:CLAMAV_SOCKET

# For spam scanning, there is a similar option that defines the interface to
# SpamAssassin. You do not need to set this if you are using the default, which
# is shown in this commented example. As for virus scanning, you must also
# modify the acl_check_data access control list to enable spam scanning.

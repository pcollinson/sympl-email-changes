# If Exim is compiled with support for TLS, you may want to enable the

# connections. In the authenticators section below, there are template
# configurations for plaintext username/password authentication. This kind
# of authentication is only safe when used within a TLS connection, so the
# authenticators will only work if the following TLS settings are turned on
# as well.

# Allow any client to use TLS.

# The private key must not be encrypted (password protected). You can put
# the certificate and private key in the same file, in which case you only
# need the first setting, or in separate files, in which case you need both
# options.

# In order to support roaming users who wish to send email from anywhere,

# case these users need to send email from a network that blocks port 25.
# The standard port for this purpose is port 587, the "message submission"
# port. See RFC 4409 for details. Microsoft MUAs cannot be configured to
# talk the message submission protocol correctly, so if you need to support
# them you should also allow TLS-on-connect on the traditional but
# non-standard port 465.

# don't break too badly.

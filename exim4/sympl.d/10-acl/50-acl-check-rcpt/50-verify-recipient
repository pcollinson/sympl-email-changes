  # We also require all accepted addresses to be verifiable. This check will
  # do local part verification for local domains, but only check the domain
  # for remote domains. The only way to check local parts for the remote
  # relay domains is to use a callout (add /callout), but please read the
  # documentation about callouts before doing this.

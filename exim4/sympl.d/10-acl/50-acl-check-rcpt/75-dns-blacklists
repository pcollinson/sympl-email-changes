.ifdef SPAMHAUS_DQ_KEY
  # Spamhaus rules
  # ==============
  #
  # It's now possible to sign up for a Spamhaus data query key
  # if you qualify as a non-commercial service.
  # See https://www.spamhaustech.com/free-trial/sign-up-for-a-free-data-query-service-account/
  #
  # These lists are considerably more current than the free public DNSBLs supplied by spamhaus.org.
  #
  # To activate
  # Define SPAMHAUS_DQ_KEY in 00-main,  I've used 00-main/35-spamhaus-key for this.
  # then create a file or files named for the lookup domain below in the blacklists directory
  # of VHOST_CONFIG_DIR - usually /srv/example.domain/config.
  #
  # You should probably not use the public rules below AND these rules, however if you are converting
  # from the public to the dq lists then the dq rules will be tested first and should the provide
  # confidence that things are working.
  #
  # This collection of rules will fire if various files are in the blacklists
  # directory of the VHOST_CONFIG_DIR for a domain.  It tries to be efficient
  # with lookups, and doesn't query the same dataset twice.
  #
  # So for example, if the files sbl.dq.spamhaus.net and sbl-xbl.dq.spamhaus.net are
  # present, only the latter list is checked.
  #
  # The following lists can be checked - by adding file with this name to
  # VHOST_CONFIG_DIR/blacklists
  #
  #  * sbl.dq.spamhaus.net
  #  * xbl.dq.spamhaus.net
  #  * pbl.dq.spamhaus.net
  #  * sbl-xbl.dq.spamhaus.net
  #  * zen.sq.spamhaus.net
  #
  #  The dbl list looks up domain names and can be included by adding the file
  #  * dbl.sq.spamhaus.net
  #
  # These rules are an edited copy of the original rule set retained below, except that it doesn't
  # expose the SPAMHAUS_DQ_KEY in logging and messages.
  # Thanks to Exim4 syntax gleaned from 'alphacabbage' Sympl forum posting

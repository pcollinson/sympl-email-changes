# This ACL is used after the contents of a message have been received. This
# is the ACL in which you can test a message's headers or body, and in
# particular, this is where you can invoke external virus or spam scanners.
# Some suggested ways of configuring these tests are shown below, commented
# out. Without any tests, this ACL accepts all messages. If you want to use
# such tests, you must ensure that Exim is compiled with the content-scanning
# extension (WITH_CONTENT_SCAN=yes in Local/Makefile).

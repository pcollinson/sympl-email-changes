# This transport is used for local delivery to user mailboxes in traditional
# BSD mailbox format. By default it will be run under the uid and gid of the
# local user, and requires the sticky bit to be set on the /var/mail directory.
# Some systems use the alternative approach of running mail deliveries under a
# particular group instead of using the sticky bit. The commented options below
# show how this can be done.

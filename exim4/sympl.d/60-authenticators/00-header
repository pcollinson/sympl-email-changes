# The following authenticators support plaintext username/password
# authentication using the standard PLAIN mechanism and the traditional
# but non-standard LOGIN mechanism, with Exim acting as the server.
# PLAIN and LOGIN are enough to support most MUA software.
#
# These authenticators are not complete: you need to change the
# server_condition settings to specify how passwords are verified.
# They are set up to offer authentication to the client only if the
# connection is encrypted with TLS, so you also need to add support
# for TLS. See the global configuration options section at the start
# of this file for more about TLS.
#
# The default RCPT ACL checks for successful authentication, and will accept
# messages from authenticated users from anywhere on the Internet.
